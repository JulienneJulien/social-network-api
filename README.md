*Built an API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friends’ thoughts, and create a friend list. This application will use* ***Express***, *a* ***MongoDB database***, *and the* ***Mongoose ODM***. *This application also uses ***Moment***, a JavaScript date library for formatting timestamps.*
